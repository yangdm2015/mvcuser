 * The Portfolio class represents a single portfolio of one of the users.
 * 
 * At this stage of the Struts 2 Porfolio development.  We haven't integrated with 
 * a persistence technology.  Later in the book, we will show how to use hibernate
 * for persisting this data.  For now, the uniqueness of portfolio object depends upon
 * its name being unique to the owner ( who is one of the users ).  These business
 * rules allow us to identify and retrieve a individual portfolio based upon the
 * owner property in combination with the name property.  When we integrate with 
 * "real" data persistence, we will use numeric keys that come from the database.
